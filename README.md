It is incredible to see how much we can learn from a simulation that takes up barely a hundred lines of code. It really puts into perspective the impact of lockdowns and face masks had. The blue line here represents- the simulation without any countermeasures. However, if you see the orange line, when we implement the lockdown, let's say on day 15, the spread of the disease is spiked for a while and there is a gradual curve backing down again. The yellow line is when we implement the face mask. This curve is the most interesting one, there is a sudden change in the gradient of the line, it would probably have increased much faster without the facemask.
